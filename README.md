# Prediction-of-Compressive-Strength-using-Multi-Layered-Perceptron

A predictive model is constructed demonstrating the possibilities of adapting a Multi-Layered 
Perceptron to envisage the compressive strength of high-performance concrete. 

### Objective 
The primary incentive of this research is to:
* Initiate an exploratory analysis of data to find the patterns of the feature that makes up the data.
* Conduct a comparative analysis of feature transformation algorithms to find the most suitable for utilization.
* Experiment with different Hyper-parameters to obtain a well-organized tuning for the MLP model.
* Locate a nominal approach to solve this problem to develop an efficient model capable of correctly predicting the strength of the concrete, given certain parameter exists.
